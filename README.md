## About
This is a mouse-free informational typing game that traverses the landmarks across UNC's campus, gives a brief information bit about the landmark, and then gives a typing test to advance onward. Each level requires a short word to be typed in to continue, but the letter you are currently typing will not change until it is the correct letter in the word (ex: if my word is apple, I will not be asked to type the first p until I correctly type a). 

The game incorporates [Responsive Voice Technology](https://responsivevoice.org/) that speaks the contents of all the pages, allowing all users to play the game.
