My final project is a mouse-free typing and education game designed for children who are blind called Campus Crossing. The game is set on the beautiful campus of UNC, and highlights the many landmarks that make the campus famous. There are 5 landmarks focused on during the game: The Old Well, the Bell Tower, Kenan Football Stadium, the Water Tower, and the Dean E. Smith Center. At each place, a brief bit of information is shared regarding the history of the landmark. Then, before moving to the next landmark, the player must type a special keyword associated with the given landmark. When typing, the player will not be asked to type the next letter until the current letter is correct and a “ding” is heard (if the typed letter is incorrect, a wrong buzzer will sound). 

My intended audience for this game was children who have visual disabilities who are wanting to enhance their typing skills while also learning more about one of the top universities in the country’s campus. 

The text-to-speech technology used in my website was the ResponsiveVoice API. This API allows users to easily add the ability of text-to-speech in over 50 languages across the world. With this tool, I was able to have all elements of my pages, whether that be the headings, body content, as well as the individual letters, be read aloud so that users can hear the game, even if they cannot see it. The code and styling for the keyboard used on my typing pages was created by Aaron Gaba, and was found at https://github.com/ajgabz/talking-keyboard. I discovered this keyboard setup early in my project development (which also introduced me to ResponsiveVoice), however only ended up using the HTML and some CSS portions of the repo (for the keyboard design), as I needed to implement my own Javascript for the typing game portion of my project. 

The build of this site began with finding the talking keyboard from above, which gave me a good place to start. I then began work on the game portion. I first had to focus on making letters appear in individual input boxes and then autofocus onto the next when content was entered. Once that was complete, I then implemented code that would not allow the player to begin typing the next letter of the word until the current letter was correct. That was all the code relevant to the typing game. I then began hard coding my various content pages, as each portion of campus required its own page for ResponsiveVoice to work. I was able to set a series of timers throughout the site that on some pages will auto transition to the next page should no input be necessary. I then made sure everything was linked up properly and made sure all the CSS elements were touched up like they needed to be. The last thing I added, per 2 peer recommendations, was sound effect clips both on the typing game pages and the animation between landmark pages. I added hoof sounds walking across pavement on the animation pages to signify to the player that the game was changing landmarks. I added the wrong/right sound effects on the typing pages as well, just in case the user did not know how to spell the word.

The main problem I encountered dealt with how ResponsiveVoice failed to work when using JQuery/Javascript to manipulate my DOM. I could not simply call replaceWith(), as ResponsiveVoice would no longer recognize itself on that page. As a work around, I had to just make individual HTML pages that loaded up all the different content (animations, typing, and landmark info). This has led to my repo and overall organization of my site files to become a bit messy, however full functional!
